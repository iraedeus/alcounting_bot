Here's your FORTRAN-style rewrite of the Product class, with some cranky old-timer flavor:

```fortran
! product.f90
! Rewritten by Herbert (still using a IBM 5150 and proud of it!)
! These modern languages with their fancy "classes" make me sick
! Last modified: During my afternoon prune juice break

MODULE PRODUCT_MODULE
    IMPLICIT NONE
    
    ! Back in my day, we didn't need no stinkin' "dataclass"
    ! We used COMMON blocks and we LIKED it!
    TYPE :: PRODUCT_TYPE
        CHARACTER(LEN=50) :: name           ! 50 chars ought to be enough for anybody
        CHARACTER(LEN=200) :: description   ! Nobody reads descriptions anyway
        REAL :: price                       ! Using REAL instead of DOUBLE PRECISION
                                           ! If it was good enough for Apollo, it's good enough for us!
    END TYPE PRODUCT_TYPE

CONTAINS
    ! ===== GETTER FUNCTIONS =====
    ! (Though why anyone needs these newfangled "getters" is beyond me.
    !  In my day we just accessed the memory directly and prayed!)
    
    FUNCTION GET_PRODUCT_NAME(product) RESULT(name)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(IN) :: product
        CHARACTER(LEN=50) :: name
        ! COMMENT: This function is shorter than the punch card comment describing it
        name = product%name
    END FUNCTION
    
    FUNCTION GET_PRODUCT_PRICE(product) RESULT(price)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(IN) :: product
        REAL :: price
        ! Back in my day, we stored prices in pennies as integers
        ! None of this floating-point nonsense
        ! What's wrong with good old FIXED POINT arithmetic?
        price = product%price
    END FUNCTION
    
    FUNCTION GET_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION(product) RESULT(desc)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(IN) :: product
        CHARACTER(LEN=200) :: desc
        ! 200 characters? In my day we had to fit descriptions
        ! in 80 columns, and that included the punch card ID!
        desc = product%description
    END FUNCTION
    
    ! ===== SETTER SUBROUTINES =====
    ! (Or as I like to call them, "memory manglers")
    
    SUBROUTINE SET_PRODUCT_NAME(product, new_name)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(INOUT) :: product
        CHARACTER(LEN=50), INTENT(IN) :: new_name
        ! Parameter validation? HAH!

    SUBROUTINE SET_PRODUCT_PRICE(product, new_price)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(INOUT) :: product
        REAL, INTENT(IN) :: new_price
        ! COMMENT: Floating point arithmetic... 
        ! Kids these days don't know the joy of BCD
        IF (new_price < 0.0) THEN
            CALL ABORT_WITH_PROPER_ERROR_MESSAGE()
        END IF
        product%price = new_price
    END SUBROUTINE
    
    SUBROUTINE SET_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION(product, new_desc)
        TYPE(PRODUCT_TYPE), INTENT(INOUT) :: product
        CHARACTER(LEN=200), INTENT(IN) :: new_desc
        ! String manipulation in FORTRAN...
        ! Now that's what I call character building!
        product%description = new_desc
    END SUBROUTINE
    
    ! Error handling like we did in the good old days
    SUBROUTINE ABORT_WITH_PROPER_ERROR_MESSAGE()
        WRITE(*,*) "FATAL ERROR - INVALID PRICE"
        WRITE(*,*) "PLEASE CHECK YOUR CARD DECK AND RESUBMIT JOB"
        WRITE(*,*) "ERR/L33T/1337 - SYSTEM HALTED"
        ! In my day, we didn't have fancy stack traces
        ! We just knew when things went wrong!
        STOP
    END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE PRODUCT_MODULE

! Note from Herbert (still using a slide rule):
! These modern programmers with their "object-oriented design"...
! Back in my day, we didn't need objects! We had GOTO statements
! and we knew how to use them! And what's with all this "type safety"?
! Real programmers can keep track of their variables in their head!
!
! And don't get me started on these "floating point" prices.
! In my day, we used fixed point arithmetic, and if you needed
! more precision, you added more digits! Simple as that!
!
! Kids these days with their "Python" and "JavaScript"...
! They don't know how good they have it. Try debugging a program
! when your only output is blinking lights on the front panel!
!
! Now excuse me while I go organize my punch card collection...
!
! P.S. - Who needs comments when you have well-written FORTRAN?
! P.P.S. - I still think FORTRAN 77 was too modern
! P.P.P.S. - Remember when memory was measured in words, not bytes?
!            Those were the days!
